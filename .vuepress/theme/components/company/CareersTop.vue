            Kestra is an open source data orchestration and scheduling platform. The project has started in 2019 and
            has a successful production usage with a major French retailer company. The company has just started
            communication 6 month ago and has reached more than 2700 stars on github in a few weeks. Being only the
            2 french founders for now, we are focused on building a strong team around this ambitious product
            that will become the defacto cloud native orchestration & scheduling tools.
