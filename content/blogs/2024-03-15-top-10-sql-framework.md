Many discussions in data analytics assume everyone uses the ELT approach, with SQL transformations happening in the data warehouse. These discussions often favor dbt as the primary tool.

But, the reality is that many teams use different data stacks and tools. This blog post unpacks the various SQL frameworks, highlighting the trade-offs each method presents for different project requirements.

## dbt core
The most popular + why is the most popular and widely adopted
But it has shortcomings discussed in this post â€“ Link to the dbt vs SQLMesh post

## 1) Airflow

- Before dbt, many data engineers used to template their SQL in Airflow DAG code.

Before the advent of dbt, many data engineers used to template their SQL queries in Airflow DAG code. In the end, dbt can be summarized as a framework to manage templated SQL queries. Using Jinja with Airflow dependencies management can be the great foundation of a SQL management platform.

- business logic vs orchestration logic

Still, this approach has one major flaw: it couples Airflow with your business logic. 

While it's possible to organize a repository with Airflow DAGs in one part and SQL queries in another, in-house tooling is often hard to manage in the long term. Onboarding new developers need dedicated training sessions and handling outlier cases often complicates the overall design, ending in over-engineering and shadow code routines.

Mixing business and orchestration logic is probably the last thing you want to do as a data engineer. Being conscious about it is a great skill to have and to foster within teams and projects. Also coupling your SQL queries to a specific orchestration engine can lock you in your own system. What if another team wants to automate their own SQL queries with another system?

## 2) Terraform

Cloud infrastructure management has undergone a revolution with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becoming the go-to approach. Tools like [Terraform](https://kestra.io/blogs/2023-09-19-kestra-terraform-partnership), with its single language (HCL), dependency management, and modular design, allow seamless configuration of diverse resources. Teams can collaborate effortlessly across different resources thanks to Terraform's providers and the unified declarative syntax, streamlining workflows for various infrastructure needs.

Declaring queries with Terraform resources is often something overlooked. But if your modeling is simple enough, using only [resources like google_bigquery_table with Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/bigquery_table) to build views on top of raw data can be a very lightweight solution.

```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_table" "dwh_organizations" {
  project = data.google_project.prd.project_id
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.dwh.dataset_id
  table_id = "organizations"
  deletion_protection = false

  view {
    query = templatefile("bigquery/dwh/simple_select.sql", {
      project = google_bigquery_dataset.ods.project
      dataset = google_bigquery_dataset.ods.dataset_id
      table = "organizations"
    })
    use_legacy_sql = false
  }
}
```
While Terraform might not be ideal for scenarios requiring complex incremental strategies, diverse materialization methods, or when data analysts lack familiarity with the tool, it excels in managing simpler pipelines. 

For instance, platform or data engineers often used to Terraform can effectively orchestrate their daily FinOps analytics pipelines this way.


## 3) y42

- modern data stack (= analytics stack) orchestrator
- not OSS

## 4) SQLMesh

SQLMesh is a recent project aiming to emphasize better operations management. It shifts from dbt in that sense by bringing several improvements:
- Environment management
- Different user interfaces: a web UI and a CLI. Both are included in the open-source version.
- Native support for multiple repositories
- SQLMesh supports Jinja templating, it also lets the user extend the SQL language itself with native support for metaprogramming constructs that enable direct invocation of functions implemented in Python.

## 5) Dataform

- Mention OSS + GCP BQ version

## 6) Quarry

- build in Rust, but it's not where it shines (the bottleneck is ultimately on the warehouse)

## 7) lea

- most mature in-house

## 8) Malloy

- SQL has not been designed for analytics
- rectangular data
- BI as code

## 9) sdf

- https://www.sdf.com/pricing
- not OSS

## 10) yato

- lightweight / get things done
- embeddable
