Run tasks as local processes.

Here is an example of a Shell script configured with the Process task runner which runs a Shell command as a child process in the Kestra host:

```yaml
id: process_script_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

The Process task runner doesnâ€™t have any additional configuration beyond the `type` property.

You can read more about the Process Task Runner its [plugin docs page](/plugins/core/task-runners/runner/io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.process).

## Benefits

The Process task runner is useful if your Kestra instance is running locally without Docker and you want to access your local files and environments, for example, to take advantage of locally configured Conda virtual environments.
