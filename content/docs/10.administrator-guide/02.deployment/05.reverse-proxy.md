title: Kestra behind a reverse proxy
---

If you want to host Kestra behind a reverse proxy, make sure to configure Kestra to use [Server Send Event (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) to display executions in real-time.

On some reverse proxies, such as Nginx, you need to disable buffering to enable real-time updates.

## Nginx

A working configuration is:
```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass  http://localhost:<kestra_port>;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_read_timeout 600s;
    proxy_redirect    off;
    proxy_set_header  Host             $http_host;
    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;

    # Needed for SSE
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_cache off;
}
```

## Micronaut configuration

If you are using a reverse proxy, you may need to adjust the `micronaut.http.services.api` configuration to include a proxy address, username, and password. This will allow you to make requests to the Kestra API through the reverse proxy in order to fetch data for the Kestra UI, such as e.g. Blueprints. Here is how you can adjust your `config.yml` file to include the necessary configuration:

```yaml
micronaut:
  http:
    services:
      api:
        url: https://api.kestra.io
        proxy-type: http
        proxy-address: my.company.proxy.address:port
        proxy-username: "username"
        proxy-password: "password"
        follow-redirects: true
```

Make sure to check the [Micronaut HttpClient Configuration](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.http.client.DefaultHttpClientConfiguration) for more information on how to configure the `DefaultHttpClientConfiguration` in your `config.yml` file.
