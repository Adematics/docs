Kestra is language agnostic. Use the Shell task to run any language.

Using `Commands`, you can run arbitrary commands in a Docker container. This means that you can use other languages as long as:
1. Their dependencies can be packaged into a Docker image
2. Their execution can be triggered from a `Shell` command line.

## Orchestrate Rust scripts

Here is an example flow using a Rust image created using the following [sample ETL project](https://github.com/kestra-io/examples/tree/main/examples/rust):

```yaml
id: rust_in_container
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: rust
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/rust:latest
    outputFiles:
      - "*.csv"
    commands:
      - etl
```

Once the container finishes execution, you'll be able to download all CSV files generated by the Rust container from the Outputs tab.

Note that the `ghcr.io/kestra-io/rust:latest` image is public, so you can directly use the example shown above and give it a try.

## Orchestrate Golang scripts

Here is an example flow that runs a Golang file inside of a container using a Golang image:

```yaml
id: golang
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: go
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
    containerImage: golang:latest
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    commands:
      - go run hello_world.go
```

The Golang code saved as a namespace file called `hello_world.go`:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
When executed, we can see the print statement in the Kestra logs:
