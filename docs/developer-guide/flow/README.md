# Flow
> Flow is the base of your workload, it defined all the tasks you want to do and theirs orders.

## Flow sample

The flow model is a yaml document describing how Kestra will schedule and compute your workload.

Here is a full sample flow demonstrating the flow definition. 
The following code is a sample existing task in Kestra for testing purposes.

## Flow Properties

```yaml
id: samples 
namespace: org.kestra.tests 
revision: 8

  - name: my-value
    type: STRING
    required: false

variables:
  first: "1"
  second: "{{vars.first}} > 2"
  third: "{{vars.second}} > 3"

tasks: 
  - id: date 
    type: org.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    description: "Some tasks **documentation** in *Markdown*"
    disabled: false
    format: "A log line content with a contextual date variable {{taskrun.startDate}}" 

errors: 
  - id: failed-echo 
    type: org.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Echo
