# Flow
In this documentation you will learn what is a flow and how to define them.

## Task kinds

There are in Kestra two tasks kinds :

* **Runnable tasks**: these tasks will handle most of the workload, this can be api call, 
  transformation, ..., anything that must be run, the kestra core don't included many tasks runnable, since they are available as plugins.
* **Flowable tasks**: they are mostly included in Kestra Core let you compose tasks together (sequential, parallel, ...). More details below.


## Flow sample

The flow model is a yaml document descibing how Kestra will schedule and compute your workload.

Here is a full sample flow demonstrating the flow definition. 
The following code is a sample existing task in Kestra for testing purposes.

## Flow Properties

```yaml
id: samples 
namespace: org.kestra.tests 
revision: 8 

inputs:
  - name: my-value
    type: STRING

variables:
  first: "1"
  second: "{{vars.first}} > 2"
  third: "{{vars.second}} > 3"

tasks: 
  - id: date 
    type: org.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return 
    format: "A log line content with a contextual date variable {{taskrun.startDate}}" 

errors: 
  - id: failed-echo 
    type: org.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Echo  
    format: second {{task.id}}

```


| Field | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
|`id`|Flow identifier, must be unique across namespaces.|
|`namespace`|Each task live in one arbitrary namespace, this is useful for task organisation. Namespace is required.|
|`revision`|Flow version, handle internally by kestra, and will be incremented for each modifications save, not required since autogenerated.|
|`inputs`|List of inputs for current flow, more details [here](../inputs/) |
|`variables`|A list of variables for the current flow that can be reach with <code v-pre>{{ vars.name }}</code>|
|`tasks`|A list of related tasks the current flow, all tasks will be run sequentially.|
|`tasks.[].id`|The task id that must be **unique** for current flow.|
|`tasks.[].type`|The task type that is a full java class name.|
|`tasks.[].xxx`|Here is a specific field for this task type (Retrun) that append a formatted line in log file stream.|
|`errors`|A list of errors tasks the current flow, all tasks will be run sequentially and will be run only if there is any error on the current execution.|
|`errors.[].xxx`|The same property as `tasks`, error can be any normal tasks, more details [here](../errors-handling/)  |
