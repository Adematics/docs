# Manual deployment

If you want to deploy by yourself, we provide a Standalone jar that allow to deploy on any environnement you want.

The latest jar can be download [here](https://api.kestra.io/v1/versions/download).

This is an executable jar:
- For Linux & MacOs, we run it `./kestra-VERSION`
- For Windows, rename the file `./kestra-VERSION` to `./kestra-VERSION.bat` and call it from `CMD`.
