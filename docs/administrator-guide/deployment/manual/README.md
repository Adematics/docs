# Manual deployment  

If you want to deploy by yourself, we provide a Standalone jar that allow to deploy on any environnement you want. 

The latest jar can be download [here](https://kestra-download-latest-xfpg5jduea-ew.a.run.app).

This is an executable jar: 
- For Linux & MacOs, we run it `./kestra-VERSION` 
- For Windows, rename the file `./kestra-VERSION` to `./kestra-VERSION.bat` and call it from `CMD`.
